# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: December 7, 2024**

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how Techducat Nigeria Limited ("we," "us," or "Company") handles your information through our Monero Wallet application, Àpò ("the App"), available on Google Play Store. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your cryptocurrency transactions.

## Overview
Àpò is a non-custodial Monero wallet that operates entirely on your device. We do not collect, process, or have access to any of your personal or financial information.

## Data Collection and Usage
Àpò does **NOT** collect, transmit, or process:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Location data
- Usage analytics or app behavior data
- Financial information beyond what's stored locally on your device
- Any data that could identify you as an individual

## Google Play Services
Àpò does not integrate with Google Play Services, Google Analytics, Google Ads, or any Google data collection frameworks.

## Information Stored Locally
The following information is stored **only on your device**:
- Wallet files and blockchain data
- Transaction history
- Wallet addresses
- Private keys and seed phrases
- Node configuration settings

**You have complete control over this data.** It never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export or backup your wallet.

## Internet Permissions
Àpò requires internet access solely to:
- Connect to Monero network nodes for blockchain synchronization
- Broadcast your transactions to the Monero network
- Retrieve blockchain data to display your balance

These connections are essential for cryptocurrency wallet functionality and do not involve any data collection by Techducat Nigeria Limited.

## Third-Party Services
Àpò may connect to:
- **Monero Network Nodes**: Required for blockchain synchronization. You can configure custom nodes in settings.
- **Remote Nodes**: If you use remote nodes, they can see your IP address but cannot link it to your wallet or transactions due to Monero's privacy features.

We do not operate these nodes and have no control over their privacy policies.

## Data Security
- All wallet data is stored locally on your device
- Your seed phrase and private keys never leave your device
- You are responsible for securing your device and backing up your wallet
- We cannot recover lost wallets or seed phrases

## Your Responsibilities
To maintain your privacy and security:
- **Backup your seed phrase** in a secure location
- **Never share** your seed phrase or private keys
- Keep your device secure with a PIN/password
- Use trusted network connections
- Consider using your own Monero node for maximum privacy

## Children's Privacy
Àpò is not intended for users under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Compliance with Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR)
While we do not collect personal data, Techducat Nigeria Limited is committed to compliance with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) 2019. Should our data practices change, we will ensure full compliance with all applicable Nigerian data protection laws.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted in the App and on our GitHub repository. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will be revised accordingly. Continued use of Àpò constitutes acceptance of any changes.

Under Nigerian law, if we were to collect personal data in the future, you would have rights including access, rectification, erasure, and the right to lodge complaints with the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB).

## Google Play Store Compliance
This privacy policy complies with Google Play's User Data policies. Àpò is classified as a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that stores all data locally on the user's device with no data transmission to developer servers.

## Data Retention
Since we do not collect any data:
- There is no data retention period
