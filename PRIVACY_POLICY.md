# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 4, 2024**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how our Monero Wallet application ("the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your cryptocurrency transactions.

## Information We Do Not Collect

Our App is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. We **DO NOT**:

- Collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- Track your identity, location, or device information
- Monitor your transactions or wallet activity
- Share any data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Require account registration or personal details
- Store your wallet data on our servers

## Information Stored Locally

The following information is stored **only on your device**:

- Wallet files and blockchain data
- Transaction history
- Wallet addresses
- Private keys and seed phrases
- Node configuration settings

**You have complete control over this data.** It never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export or backup your wallet.

## Blockchain Interaction

To function properly, the App connects to Monero network nodes to:

- Synchronize blockchain data
- Broadcast transactions
- Check balances and transaction status

These connections are necessary for wallet functionality. The Monero blockchain is public by design, but transactions are cryptographically private and untraceable.

## Third-Party Services

The App may connect to:

- **Monero Network Nodes**: Required for blockchain synchronization. You can configure custom nodes in settings.
- **Remote Nodes**: If you use remote nodes, they can see your IP address but cannot link it to your wallet or transactions due to Monero's privacy features.

We do not operate these nodes and have no control over their privacy policies.

## Data Security

- All wallet data is stored locally on your device
- Your seed phrase and private keys never leave your device
- You are responsible for securing your device and backing up your wallet
- We cannot recover lost wallets or seed phrases

## Your Responsibilities

To maintain your privacy and security:

- **Backup your seed phrase** in a secure location
- **Never share** your seed phrase or private keys
- Keep your device secure with a PIN/password
- Use trusted network connections
- Consider using your own Monero node for maximum privacy

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for users under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted in the App and on our GitHub repository. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of any changes.

## Open Source

This App is open source. You can review the code at: https://github.com/niyid/niyid

## Your Rights

As we do not collect any personal data:

- There is no data to request, modify, or delete
- You maintain complete control of all wallet data on your device
- You can uninstall the App at any time to remove all local data

**Remember: With great privacy comes great responsibility. You are your own bank. Secure your seed phrase and private keys carefully.**
